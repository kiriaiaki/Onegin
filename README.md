Hello!
This program takes text from a file and writes it to another file:
1) Text sorted in ascending order;
2) Text sorted in ascending order, comparing lines from the end;
3) The original text stored in the file;
Sorting method: bubble.
For example, we'll use Alexander Pushkin's novella "Eugene Onegin," which is stored in the file Onegin.txt.
The output is in the file Answer.txt.
